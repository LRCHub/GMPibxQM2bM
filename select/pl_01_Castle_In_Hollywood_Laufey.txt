I rack my brain
Spend hours and days
I still can't figure it out
What happened that year
in our house?
Still learning to live without you
I wonder what
you tell your friends
Which version of our fairy story
The one where you walk out in glory
Or the night I moved out in a hurry
I think about you always
Tied together with a string
I thought that lilies died by winter,
then they bloomed again in spring
It's a heartbreak
Marked the end of our girlhood
We'll never go back to our castle
in Hollywood
Thirty months have come and gone
I'm dating the boy
that we dreamed of
I wish I could tell him about us
I wish I could tell you
how I finally fell in love
There's not a single day
Where I didn't wish
we were better
That I couldn't borrow your sweater
We were meant to be forever and ever
I think about you always
Tied together with a string
I thought that lilies died by winter,
then they bloomed again in spring
It's a heartbreak
Marked the end of our girlhood
We'll never go back to our castle
in Hollywood
I wish you well
I wish like hell you hadn't lied
We could be fine
The way I dress, over obsess
Still just like you
I owe it to the best,
worst friend I've ever had
I think about you always
Tied together with a string
I thought that lilies died by winter,
then they bloomed again in spring
My first heartbreak
Marked the end of my girlhood
I'll never go back to our castle
in Hollywood
