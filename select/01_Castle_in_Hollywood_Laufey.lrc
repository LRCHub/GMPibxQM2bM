[00:02.42] I rack my brain
[00:04.13] Spend hours and days
[00:06.02] I still can't figure it out
[00:10.30] What happened that year in our house?
[00:13.99] Still learning to live without you
[00:18.67] I wonder what you tell your friends
[00:22.26] Which version of our fairy story
[00:26.65] The one where you walk out in glory
[00:30.31] Or the night I moved out in a hurry
[00:34.97] I think about you always
[00:37.52] Tied together with a string
[00:39.43] I thought that lilies died by winter
[00:41.84] Then they bloomed again in spring
[00:43.95] It's a heartbreak
[00:45.72] Marked the end of our girlhood
[00:47.95] We'll never go back to our castle in Hollywood
[00:55.79] 30 months have come and gone
[00:59.13] I'm dating the boy that we dreamed of
[01:03.27] I wish I could tell him about us
[01:07.36] I wish I could tell you how I finally fell in love
[01:12.59] There's not a single day
[01:15.42] Where I didn't wish we were better
[01:19.46] That I couldn't borrow your sweater
[01:23.27] We were meant to be forever and ever
[01:28.05] I think about you always
[01:30.26] Tied together with a string
[01:32.51] I thought that lilies died by winter
[01:34.58] Then they bloomed again in spring
[01:36.84] It's a heartbreak
[01:38.41] Marked the end of our girlhood
[01:40.78] We'll never go back to our castle in Hollywood
[01:47.95] I wish you well
[01:49.82] I wish like hell you hadn't lied
[01:53.90] We could be fine
[01:56.06] The way I dress, over obsess
[01:59.82] Still just like you
[02:02.17] I owe it to the best, worst friend I've ever had
[02:12.41] I think about you always
[02:14.67] Tied together with a string
[02:17.28] I thought that lilies died by winter
[02:19.40] Then they bloomed again in spring
[02:21.58] My first heartbreak
[02:23.40] Marked the end of my girlhood
[02:25.63] I'll never go back to our castle in Hollywood
